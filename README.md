## CAS Planner
Allows users to create CAS scenarios in order to mission plan for training missions. 

### Chits
In order to add chits to the map, either enter in MGRS grids in the top left box and click the "Fly to Coordinates" button or click anywhere on the map. Once the popup box shows on the map with the coordinates, that then signals that the map is listening to the images of chits on the left toolbar. Click on the chit to add it to the map.
Any chit that is a threat, target, or hostile chit is able to hold 9-line information. Any survivor chit is able to hold 15-line information.

### Threats
When adding a threat to the map, a modal will display where the user can either enter in a custom threat with custom color, range, and units for the map. Whatever the user names the threat will display on the map. If the user chooses one of the UNCLASSIFIED preset threats, then the name and range will be automatically selected and cannot be changed.

### CAPs
When adding a cap to the map, a modal will display where the user can choose the distance, angle, and color of a CAP ellipse to display on the map. NOTE: Where the user clicks will be the center point of the ellipse.

### Deleting Chits
The user can either click on the chit to delete it, or delete all chits by clicking the "Clear" button

### Saving the scenario
Clicking on the save button will display a modal with a text representation of the scenario. The user can either copy this and save it to their computer. However, if they are signed into the system, then they will be able to save the scenario text to their account which they can then subsequently load.

### Map settings
Clicking on the map settings icon in the upper right of the map allows users to change the basemap imagery of the site. They can also turn on and off labels, roads, and airspace. They can also turn on and off chits, threat rings, and threat labels.

### Drawing on the map
Drawing in the map, there are tools for FEBA, FLOT, EAs, ROZs, and other polygons. Simply click on the map to create the line. These lines and shapes are all saved in the scenario. They can be renamed and deleted in the same manner as chits.

### Using the Analysis tool
Simply click on the analysis tool and then click anywhere on the map to start measuring. Then the next point you click will be the end of the tool. Continuing to click will simply add to the route. Press the ESC key to end the measuring. Pressing ESC a second time will exit the tool.

### TIPS
#### Stacking Chits
For CSAR maps particularly, some SANDY01 pilots desire to display various rings to identify where the responsibilities are in the terminal area. However, if you click on the same spot on the map where a range ring exists, the system will register the click as clicking on the ring rather than creating a new one. To stack the rings, instead, copy the MGRS grids of the ring and then paste them to the "fly to coordinates" box and then create the new range ring. This way the rings will "stack" on each other on the same point in space.
